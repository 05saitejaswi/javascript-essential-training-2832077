## Instructions

This repository does not have any branches. Download the entire repository and you get the exercise files in their final state.

Each folder corresponds with a movie with an exercise file. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the folder named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.

Some movies will have a beginning and an end state. In the exercise files, the end-state for a movie is marked with an `e` for "end" as in `02_03e`. This folder contains the code as it is at the end of the movie.

## Installing

1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
   - A code editor ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended)
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

   - [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
2. From the root folder, open the terminal and enter the command `nmp install` to install dependencies.
